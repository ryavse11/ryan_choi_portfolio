<h1 align="left">AMER Marketing VoC Reporting </h1>


<h2 align="left">Summary </h2>

AWS AMER Marketing VoC Reporting aims to gather customer sentiment and aggregate the feedback into a Tableau dashboard that AWS AMER marketing stakeholders can see to understand each campaign's impact on customer behavior and propensity. Chungwoo(Ryan) led the project and built the AMER VoC reporting leveraging AWS Salesforce data, Tableau data source, survey flow, survey work process map, and the API provided by Qualtrics.

<h2 align="left">Implementation </h2>

To collect valid customer feedback for VoC reporting, Chungwoo(Ryan) created the AMER Marketing work process map (see below) and built multiple Qualtrics survey questionnaires to help AWS marketing reps streamline the data feed process. The streamlined process map that Chungwoo(Ryan) created is used by all marketing reps when they converse with the customers and collect customer sentiment. The work process map is currently incorporated in the AWS AMER marketing Wiki page for reference.

Chungwoo connected the AMER VoC reporting with the Qualtrics survey tool. The automated VoC report is used by all AMER marketing managers, campaign owners, campaign managers, MRC managers, reps, and AWS FM (field marketing) stakeholders. Ryan supported the AWS marketing stakeholders by customizing the VoC report to track customer sentiment on their AWS Campaigns and Events. Qualtrics data is extracted into the AWS FMBI data repository and combined with SFDC data daily using Campaign Member ID in SFDC as a primary key to pull the corresponding collected customer sentiment on the report.

<h2 align="left">Business Impact </h2>

The Global Marketing Segment analysis provided the segment leaders and campaign managers with complete visibility of region, sub-region, and sub-segment performances. In AMER, after three months of zero Marketing Qualified Leads(MQLs) in Q4 2022, the team generated their first ENT Greenfield MQLs and SQLs in February 2023 from the F200 Priority campaign, resulting in a SQL pipeline of $108k. In LATAM SMB, the team was more efficient in email outreach and achieved 197% attainment. AMER startup segment achieved an MQL YoY increase of 456%. Given the visibility of segment performance and recent segment capacity adjustment, the AWS segment teams look forward to the growth and impact of working with high-quality leads prioritized in the corresponding segments using the data from the segment analysis.
