<h1 align="left">Global Marketing Segment Analysis </h1>


<h2 align="left">Summary </h2>

Chungwoo (Ryan) led the Global Marketing Segment Analysis project to enable the AWS global marketing teams to track key metrics, which includes teams' contribution to field marketing, month-over-month performance for each segment, regional performance vs. goals, and sub-segment drill-down results. He built and demonstrated the Global Segment Analysis dashboard for the global segment leadership, marketing managers, and campaign managers in the AWS marketing team to help them track each team's KPI attainment and regional field marketing performance at a segment/sub-segment level. He used Tableau and multiple data sources within Field Marketing Business Intelligence (FMBI) Redshift clusters.


<h2 align="left">Implementation </h2>

While building the datasource and the Tableau worksheets, reports, and dashboard, I kept looking into the global marketing teamâ€™s data infrastructure and explored the field marketing datasets in Amazon FMBI cluster to customize the datasource and improve the datasource loading speed. I applied a broad range of data exploration and data source build approaches (including data source mode into extract) as the project relates to field marketing and segment analysis that would used to non-tech managers every day. To that end, I also optimized ETL jobs to improve the data loading performance when aggregating daily incremental data update and sub-segment dataset performance. To visualize the data, I used Tableau Creator also appied the embedded statistical analysis methods (e.g.regression) to provide the stakeholder with in-depth analytical report and help them understand detailed each tier 1 campaign's business impact on each segment. I delivered the global marketing segment dashboard, documentations, and three enablement sessions for the segment leaders as project  deliverables.

To implement the project, Chungwoo (Ryan) prioritized communicating with stakeholders by leading weekly sprint meetings with global segment leaders and commercial/public sector(CS/PS) managers, marketing managers, and marketing ops teams. He also worked with all internal partners to refine and rebuild the data source to customize the field marketing(FM) dataset to analyze the segment goals and KPI attainment. He had regular retrospective meetings with the stakeholders and partners to provide updates on the project's progress and receive further requests. While building the data source and the Tableau dashboard, he worked closely with data engineers, data scientists, and other BIEs to deliver the Global Marketing Segment Dashboard. Chungwoo believes communicating with all stakeholders and internal partners was the key to the success of the AWS Segment Analysis project.

<h2 align="left">Business Impact </h2>

The Global Marketing Segment Anlysis provided the segment leaders and campaign managers with the improved visibilities on sub-segment performances. In AMER, after several months of zero Marketing Qualified Leads(MQLs) in Q4 2022, the team generated their first ENT Greenfiled MQLs and SQLs in February 2023 from the F200 Priority campaign resulting SQL pipeline of $108k. In LATAM SMB, the team was able to be more efficient in its email outreach and achieve 197.0% attainment. AMER startup segment worked achieved MQL YoY increase of 456%. Given the recent adjustment in segment capacity, the team look forward to the growth and impact working high quality leads in the corresponding segments using the data from the segment analysis.
