<h1 align="left">Global Marketing Segment Analysis </h1>


<h2 align="left">Summary </h2>

The Global Marketing Segment Analysis was implemented with the intent of tracking the following metrics. 
1. Global marketing teams' contribution to field marketing
2. Month-over-month performance for each segment
3. AWS marketing region performance vs. monthly/annual goals
4. sub-segment and sub-region drill-down results

The segment analysis results and the dashboard are viewed by all segment leadership, global marketing managers, and marketing reps in AWS marketing team to track each team's KPI attainment and regional field marketing performance at a segment/sub-segment level. I built and delivered the Global Segment Analysis dashboard using Tableau and multiple datasources that I built using Amazon Field Marketing Business Intelligence (FMBI) Redshift clusters.





<h2 align="left">Implementation </h2>

I started the project with communicating with the internal customers, who were global segment leaders and commercial/public sector(CS/PS) leaders. Also, I worked with the internal partners to refine and re-build the data source to use the field marketing(FM) dataset to compare with the segment goals and KPIs. I set up a regular meetings with all the stakeholders and partners shown below to understand the business context and recommend alternatives and handle further requests. In addition to stakeholders, I worked with partner teams including Data Engineering, Data Scientist, and other BIEs teams to design and deliver the analysis report and the Global Marketing Segment Dashboard. Communicating with all the stakeholders and internal partner teams were the key to success of the AWS segment analysis project.

While building the datasource and the Tableau worksheets, reports, and dashboard, I kept looking into the global marketing teamâ€™s data infrastructure and explored the field marketing datasets in Amazon FMBI cluster to customize the datasource and improve the datasource loading speed. I applied a broad range of data exploration and data source build approaches (including data source mode into extract) as the project relates to field marketing and segment analysis that would used to non-tech managers every day. To that end, I also optimized ETL jobs to improve the data loading performance when aggregating daily incremental data update and sub-segment dataset performance. To visualize the data, I used Tableau Creator also appied the embedded statistical analysis methods (e.g.regression) to provide the stakeholder with in-depth analytical report and help them understand detailed each tier 1 campaign's business impact on each segment. I delivered the global marketing segment dashboard, documentations, and three enablement sessions for the segment leaders as project  deliverables.

<h2 align="left">Business Impact </h2>

The Global Marketing Segment Anlysis provided the segment leaders and campaign managers with the improved visibilities on sub-segment performances. In AMER, after several months of zero Marketing Qualified Leads(MQLs) in Q4 2022, the team generated their first ENT Greenfiled MQLs and SQLs in February 2023 from the F200 Priority campaign resulting SQL pipeline of $108k. In LATAM SMB, the team was able to be more efficient in its email outreach and achieve 197.0% attainment. AMER startup segment worked achieved MQL YoY increase of 456%. Given the recent adjustment in segment capacity, the team look forward to the growth and impact working high quality leads in the corresponding segments using the data from the segment analysis.
