<h1 align="left">Global Marketing Segment Analysis </h1>


<h2 align="left">Summary </h2>

Chungwoo(Ryan) led the Global Marketing Segment Analysis project and provided the AWS global marketing teams with full visibility into track key metrics, which included teams' contribution to field marketing, month-over-month performance for each segment, regional performance vs. goals, and sub-segment drill-down results. He built the analytics and data strategy and presented the Global Segment Analysis dashboard for the global segment leadership, marketing managers, and campaign managers in the AWS marketing team to help them utilize each team's KPI attainment and regional field marketing performance at a segment/sub-segment level for Quarterly Business Reviews.


<h2 align="left">Implementation </h2>

Leveraging his data engineering and BIE experience, Chungwoo(Ryan) also built dedicated data sources for the segment analysis project and optimized related ETL jobs in AWS Datanet (Amazon's ETL tool) to improve the data efficiency and report loading performance for the daily data aggregation process. He applied a broad range of data exploration on field marketing data, tested multiple data extract modes, and built 30+ Tableau worksheets and four dashboards for the project. He applied statistical analysis methods (e.g. regression) to provide the stakeholders with in-depth analytical insights into the AWS tier 1 campaign's business impact on each global segment.

To implement the project, Chungwoo(Ryan) prioritized communicating with marketing/sales stakeholders by leading weekly sprint and scrum meetings with global segment leaders and commercial/public sector (CS/PS) managers, sales managers, and marketing ops teams. He worked with internal partners to refine the data set and build independent data sources by restructuring the field marketing(FM) dataset and analyzing the segment goals and KPI attainment. He provided bi-weekly updates on the project's progress and received further requests from retrospective meetings with the stakeholders. While building data sources and Tableau reports/dashboards, he worked closely with data engineers, data scientists, and other BIEs to optimize the data pipelines for the Global Marketing Segment Dashboard. Chungwoo(Ryan) believes effective communications with business stakeholders and data engineering team was the key to success of the Global Segment Analysis project.

<h2 align="left">Business Impact </h2>

The Global Marketing Segment analysis provided the segment leaders and campaign managers with complete visibility of region, sub-region, and sub-segment performances. In AMER, after three months of zero Marketing Qualified Leads(MQLs) in Q4 2022 in ENT Greenfield, the team generated their first ENT Greenfield MQLs and subsequent SQLs in February 2023 from the F200 Priority campaign, resulting in a SQL pipeline of $108k. In LATAM SMB, the team referenced the segment results from the analysis, focused on a few specific segments, worked on email outreach and achieved 197% attainment for Q3 2023. AMER startup segment achieved an MQL YoY increase of 456% for Q2 2023. Given the clear visibility of segment performance and recent segment capacity adjustment allowed, the AWS segment leaders and teams can look forward to further growth and the impact of working with high-quality leads prioritized in the corresponding segments using the data from the global segment analysis.
