<h1 align="left">Global Marketing Segment Analysis </h1>


<h2 align="left">Summary </h2>

Chungwoo(Ryan) led the Global Marketing Segment Analysis project and enabled the AWS global marketing teams to track key metrics, which included teams' contribution to field marketing, month-over-month performance for each segment, regional performance vs. goals, and sub-segment drill-down results. He built and demonstrated the Global Segment Analysis dashboard for the global segment leadership, marketing managers, and campaign managers in the AWS marketing team to help them track each team's KPI attainment and regional field marketing performance at a segment/sub-segment level. 


<h2 align="left">Implementation </h2>

Chungwoo(Ryan) built dedicated data sources for the segment analysis project and optimized related ETL jobs in AWS Datanet to improve the data efficiency and report loading performance for the daily data aggregation process. He applied a broad range of data exploration on field marketing data, tested multiple data extract modes, and built 30+ Tableau worksheets and four dashboards for the project. He applied statistical analysis methods (e.g., regression) to provide the stakeholders with in-depth analytical insights into the AWS tier 1 campaign's business impact on each global segment.

To implement the project, Chungwoo(Ryan) prioritized communicating with stakeholders by leading weekly sprint meetings with global segment leaders and commercial/public sector(CS/PS) managers, marketing managers, and marketing ops teams. He also worked with all internal partners to refine and rebuild the data source to customize the field marketing(FM) dataset to analyze the segment goals and KPI attainment. He had regular retrospective meetings with the stakeholders and partners to provide updates on the project's progress and receive further requests. While building the data source and the Tableau dashboard, he worked closely with data engineers, data scientists, and other BIEs to deliver the Global Marketing Segment Dashboard. Chungwoo(Ryan) believes communicating with all stakeholders and internal partners was the key to the success of the AWS Segment Analysis project.

<h2 align="left">Business Impact </h2>

The Global Marketing Segment analysis provided the segment leaders and campaign managers with complete visibility of region, sub-region, and sub-segment performances. In AMER, after three months of zero Marketing Qualified Leads(MQLs) in Q4 2022, the team generated their first ENT Greenfield MQLs and SQLs in February 2023 from the F200 Priority campaign, resulting in a SQL pipeline of $108k. In LATAM SMB, the team was more efficient in email outreach and achieved 197% attainment. AMER startup segment achieved an MQL YoY increase of 456%. Given the visibility of segment performance and recent segment capacity adjustment, the AWS segment teams look forward to the growth and impact of working with high-quality leads prioritized in the corresponding segments using the data from the segment analysis.
