<h2 align="left">Summary </h2>

Chungwoo created an online dashboard catalog to provide the AMER marketing stakeholders with an up-to-date list of dashboards/reports that he created for the AWS marketing and sales stakeholders. With detailed information on Chungwoo's analytics deliverables, stakeholders can quickly navigate the list and find the right report containing the needed data. The catalog shows each report's intended audience, metrics, insights, data refreshing schedule, and last modified/updated date. The catalog also provides a preview feature where stakeholders can check the thumbnail images and screen grabs of each report without pulling the whole report. The stakeholders can save time using the live dashboard catalog and quickly review the entire component in the reports listed before opening the full report.

While working with the AWS AMER team, Chungwoo has built 150+ in-depth reports, global-scale dashboards, and live data sources using custom SQLs to provide AWS marketing and sales stakeholders with a single source of truth that they use daily to achieve business goals. The online dashboard catalog is a self-service tool Chungwoo offered to global sales managers, marketing stakeholders, and AWS sales reps to explore detailed data/numbers needed for different purposes from Tableau, Quicksight, and SFDC reports as quickly as possible. The live catalog provides the up-to-date URLs of all BI/analytics reports with preview features, intended audience, metrics, data, and insights. 

The catalog received a number of accolades in AWS; the stakeholders commented that it helped them find the insights they needed within a few seconds and solved the problem of outdated reports/dashboards/data sources. Also, the stakeholders mentioned that the catalog prevented the redundant efforts of requesting a new report because the live catalog gives them a holistic view of up-to-date KPIs, filter values available, and example datasets that can be pulled from each dashboard.
