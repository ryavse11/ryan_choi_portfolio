<h2 align="left">Summary </h2>

Chungwoo created an online dashboard catalog to provide the AMER marketing stakeholders with an up-to-date list of dashboards/reports that Ryan created for the AWS marketing and sales stakeholders. With detailed information on Chungwoo's analytics deliverables, the stakeholders can quickly navigate the list and find the report containing the needed data. The catalog shows each report's intended audience, metrics, insights, data refreshing schedule, and last modified/updated date. The catalog also provides a preview feature where the stakeholders can quickly check the thumbnails and screen grabs of each report without pulling the whole report. The stakeholders can save time and quickly review all the components before opening the report.

Chungwoo has created in-depth reports, global scale dashboards, and multiple live data sources using custom SQLs to provide AWS marketing and sales stakeholders with a single source of truth that they use daily for various purposes. The online dashboard catalog is a self-service tool designed for global sales managers, marketing stakeholders, and AWS sales reps to search Tableau and SFDC reports and detailed data/numbers needed for different purposes. The dashboard catalog provides the up-to-date URLs of all BI/analytics reports with preview features, intended audience, metrics, data, and insights to help the teams navigate the catalog and readily pull the data out of a selected report.

With his business intelligence engineering and DBA (database administrator) experience, Chungwoo has created BI reports, data pipelines, and data sources. Communicating with the data engineering team and sales stakeholders, he learned that data analysis deliverables should be easily found and pulled with intended insights so they can offer actionable insights to help the AWS marketing stakeholders when they are needed. Chungwoo is willing to go the extra mile and take the initiative to provide additional BIE support and enablement to add value to the business.
