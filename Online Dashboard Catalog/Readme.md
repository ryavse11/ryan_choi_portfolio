<h1 align="left">Live Dashboard Catalog </h1>


<h2 align="left">Summary </h2>

Chungwoo created an online dashboard catalog to provide the AMER marketing stakeholders with an up-to-date list of dashboards/reports that he created for the AWS marketing and sales stakeholders. With detailed information on Chungwoo's analytics deliverables, stakeholders can quickly navigate the list and find the right report containing the needed data. The catalog shows each report's intended audience, metrics, insights, data refreshing schedule, and last modified/updated date. The catalog also provides a preview feature where stakeholders can see the thumbnail images and screen grabs of each report without pulling the whole report. The stakeholders can save time using the live dashboard catalog and quickly review the entire component in the reports listed before opening the full report.

<h2 align="left">Feedback </h2>

The catalog received positive feedback from stakeholders. It helped them explore the list and find the metrics they were looking for quickly and solved problems of pulling the wrong dashboards or outdated reports. The team noted that the online dashboard catalog prevented redundant efforts of building or requesting new ones as the live catalog displays all up-to-date KPIs, filter values available, and example datasets for each analytical deliverable.

While working with the AWS AMER team, Chungwoo has built 150+ in-depth reports, global-scale dashboards, and live data sources using custom SQLs to provide AWS marketing and sales stakeholders with a single source of truth that they use daily to achieve business goals. The online dashboard catalog is a self-service tool Chungwoo offered to global sales managers, marketing stakeholders, and AWS sales reps to explore detailed data/numbers needed for different purposes from Tableau, Quicksight, and SFDC reports as quickly as possible. The live catalog provides the up-to-date URLs of all BI/analytics reports with preview features, intended audience, metrics, data, and insights.
