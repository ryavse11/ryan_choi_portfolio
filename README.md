<h1 align="center">DATA ANALYTICS POTFOLIO</h1>
  
Welcome to my <a href="https://ryavse11.github.io/ryan_choi_portfolio/">Data Analyst Portfolio!</a>

I am an analytics program manager and data analyst with 15+ years of experience in data analysis, business intelligence, data engineering, and project/program management. I love working with large-scale structured/unstructured datasets. I have a solid understanding of data analytics skill sets such as engineering statistics, data cleansing, data mining, predictive analytics, and data visualization.

In addition to my technical skills, I pride myself on my critical thinking and problem-solving abilities, which I have developed over the past 15+ years working in the tech industry. I approach data analysis with a strategic mindset, see opportunities in the data, and identify optimal solutions. 

I hope you find my portfolio informative and engaging. I welcome any opportunities to discuss my qualifications further with you.

I look forward to hearing from you soon. Thank you!
