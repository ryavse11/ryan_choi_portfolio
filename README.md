Welcome to my <a href="https://ryavse11.github.io/ryan_choi_portfolio/">Data Analyst Portfolio!</a>

I am a techincal program manager with 15+ years of experience in data analysis, business intelligence, data engineering, and project/program management.

Throughout my tech career, I have firmly believed in the power of "doing one more" and I have been willing to go "the extra mile" to contribute to business by adding more value. I consider myself a customer/stakeholder-oriented team player aiming to generate high satisfaction levels by delivering optimal data-driven solutions. In this portfolio, I have included projects showcasing my data analytics skills. You will find links to the dashboards and reports I have created using various tools. 

In addition to my technical skills, I pride myself on my critical thinking and problem-solving abilities that I have developed for the past 15 years working with global tech companies. I can approach data analysis with a strategic mindset, see opportunities in the data, and identify critical issues and solutions to resolve them. 

I am confident that my data analytics skills and technical program/project management experience make me an ideal candidate for data analyst/data program manager role. I hope you find my portfolio informative and engaging, and I welcome any opportunity to discuss my qualifications further with you.
